# Multi-CTF-Tasks-Deploy
Repository to deploy multiple CTF tasks instances using docker.

You can create multiple CTF instances hosted on the same server automatically.

## Configuration

Every Docker container is defined by a single folder under `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/`. For the time being you need to manually create that folders tree and then you copy `templates/tasks/*` inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/`.

There are 2 configuration files:

- `docker-compose-files/dcf-[YOUR_CUSTOM_CTF_NAME].yml`: This file will define the docker containers that will be created. You can check an example in
[docker-compose-files/dcf-example.yml.example](docker-compose-files/dcf-example.yml.example). You can create your own files or you can rename that file and use it on your own way.
- `config.json`: This file will define the reverse proxy configuration. This is mainly used to serve HTTP(S) requests. If you'll need this feature, you have to copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and edit it on your own way.

After you create the container's project inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/` using `templates/tasks` template, you need to edit the following files based on your need:

- Copy `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/config.json.example` to `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/config.json` and edit it.
- Define the global system initialization needed for the Docker container inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/setup/init.sh`.
- Create the setup tasks folders inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/setup/setup-task/` and create the script `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/setup/setup-task/{taskX}/task.sh` that will define how the task should be setup (including the system initialization for that particular task).
- Create the setup exception folders inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/setup/setup-exception/` and create the script `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/setup/setup-exception/{taskX}/task.sh` that will apply some updates that were previously overrided by the automatic setup (the permissions for example).
- Edit the `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/sbin/restart-services.sh` script and add the commands used to restart the global services
- Create the task restart folders inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/sbin/` and create the script `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/sbin/{taskX}/restart.sh` that will be used to restart a specific task using the root permissions (similar to `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/sbin/restart-services.sh`).
- Create the task restart folders inside `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/bin/` and create the script `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/bin/{taskX}/restart.sh` that will be used to restart a specific task using the task user permissions

### Project structure

#### Global structure (top directory)

| File path | Description | Writable |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `load-config.sh` | Bash script that is used by many scripts that will load the project configuration for an easy access. There is no need to run it manually. | No |
| `0-all-setup.sh` | Bash script that will setup the enabled Docker containers and their tasks and it will automatically start them.<br/>In order to do that it will execute the following Bash scripts:<br/><ul><li>`1-setup-docker.sh`</li><li>`2-create-new-projects-docker.sh`</li><li>`2-create-new-projects-nginx.sh`</li><li>`3-init-letsencrypt.sh`</li><li>`4-rebuild-containers.sh`</li><li>`5-restart-tasks.sh`</li></ul>Execution format:<br/><ul><li>`./0-all-setup.sh.sh` : this will run the script over all the enabled containers and tasks with no restriction</li><li>`./0-all-setup.sh [CONTAINER_NAME1] [CONTAINER_NAME2] [etc]` : This will run the script over the mentioned container names only. This restriction is propagated also to `4-rebuild-containers.sh` and `5-restart-tasks.sh`<ul><li>Example: `./0-all-setup.sh f21web1 f21web3 f21pwn1`.</li></ul></li></ul> | No |
| `1-setup-docker.sh` | Bash script that will initialize the system to make the project work correctly (this includes Docker setup, etc). This script is managed by `0-all-setup.sh` and will be executed once because every time it's executed, a temp file is created locally as `.setup_done` and will prevent it from running again. | No |
| `2-create-new-projects-docker.sh` | Bash script that will create the docker-compose file for the reverse proxy and certbot (for the time being it can't create them for the tasks). This is done based on `templates/docker-compose-common-template.yml`. When dealing with multiple docker-compose files [the volumes paths should be absolute not relative](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/8275). This is automatically handled by this script. | No |
| `2-create-new-projects-nginx.sh` | Bash script that will create the virtual host configurations under `nginx/sites-enabled/[NAME].conf` and the `nginx/snippets/snakeoil-[NAME].conf` files if TLS is enabled for that specific task. The tasks list that will require the creation of virtual hosts that will be hosted behind the reverse proxy is defined in `config.json` | No |
| `3-init-letsencrypt.sh` | Bash script that will generate the TLS certificates using certbot for all the tasks that are configured in `config.json` for every task that have `projects[].tls-enabled` set as `1`. When the setup is enabled, it'll start by backuping the recently generated TLS certificate from `data/certbot/live/[HOSTNAME]` to `data/certbot/live/[HOSTNAME].bak.[TIMESTAMP]` (used in case certbot server deny the TLS certificate generation request which occurs when the TLS certificate was already generated recently), the certbot configuration files are then generated in `data/certbot/conf/[HOSTNAME].ini` based on the template `templates/letsencrypt-template.ini` and then the script will continue by generating a temporary self-signed TLS certificate valid for 1 day that will be used to enable the HTTPS traffic on the reverse proxy server for that specific task. Obviously the reverse proxy server is restarted after this step. Then, the script check if the web page is reachable or not and when it's reachable, the TLS certificate generation process using certbot starts. This verification is important because if certbot servers receive a lot of requests to generate the same TLS certificate, it'll deny the request. The process is defined with 2 steps: the email registration for the certificate's owner and then comes the TLS certificate generation. Once these 2 steps are performed, the reverse proxy is restarted whatever the result (successful TLS generation or failed). | No |
| `4-rebuild-containers.sh` | Bash script that will rebuild the Docker containers defined in `docker-compose-files/dcf-*.yml`. Then it'll setup the tasks inside the Docker containers using `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/setup-container.sh`.<br/>Execution format:<br/><ul><li>`./4-rebuild-containers.sh` : this will run the script over all the enabled containers and tasks with no restriction</li><li>`./4-rebuild-containers.sh [CONTAINER_NAME1] [CONTAINER_NAME2] [etc]` : This will run the script over the mentioned container names only.<ul><li>Example: `./4-rebuild-containers.sh f21web1 f21web3 f21pwn1`.</li></ul></li></ul> | No |
| `4-redeploy-containers.sh` | Bash script that will redeploy the Docker containers from the pre-built docker images defined in `docker-compose-files/dcf-*.yml`.<br/>Execution format:<br/><ul><li>`./4-redeploy-containers.sh` : this will run the script over all the enabled containers and tasks with no restriction</li><li>`./4-redeploy-containers.sh [CONTAINER_NAME1] [CONTAINER_NAME2] [etc]` : This will run the script over the mentioned container names only.<ul><li>Example: `./4-redeploy-containers.sh f21web1 f21web3 f21pwn1`.</li></ul></li></ul> | No |
| `4-renew-certificates.sh` | Bash script that will execute `2-create-new-projects-docker.sh`, `2-create-new-projects-nginx.sh` and `3-init-letsencrypt.sh` in order to update the projects in case anything is missing, then it renew the TLS certificates using certbot according to the configuration that was set in `config.json` | No |
| `4-stop-containers.sh` | Bash script that will stop all the containers defined in `docker-compose-files/dcf-*.yml`.<br/>Execution format:<br/><ul><li>`./4-stop-containers.sh` : this will run the script over all the enabled containers and tasks with no restriction</li><li>`./4-stop-containers.sh [CONTAINER_NAME1] [CONTAINER_NAME2] [etc]` : This will run the script over the mentioned container names only.<ul><li>Example: `./4-stop-containers.sh f21web1 f21web3 f21pwn1`.</li></ul></li></ul> | No |
| `5-restart-tasks.sh` | Bash script that will restart the services and the tasks within the Docker containers defined in `docker-compose-files/dcf-*.yml` using `projects/[PREFIX]/[TYPE]/[ID]/restart-tasks.sh`.<br/>Execution format:<br/><ul><li>`./5-restart-tasks.sh` : this will run the script over all the enabled containers and tasks with no restriction</li><li>`./5-restart-tasks.sh [CONTAINER_NAME1] [CONTAINER_NAME2] [etc]` : This will run the script over the mentioned container names only.<ul><li>Example: `./5-restart-tasks.sh f21web1 f21web3 f21pwn1`.</li></ul></li></ul>| No |
| `5-restart-proxy.sh` | Bash script that will restart the reverse proxy Docker container defined in `docker-compose-files/docker-compose-files/dcf-docker-compose-common.yml` after refreshing the Nginx and Docker configuration | No |
